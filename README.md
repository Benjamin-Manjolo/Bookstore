# Bookstore

Author : **Benjamin Manjolo**
This is a PERN Stack–based project titled Bookstore Inventory Manager. It is a full-stack CRUD application designed to manage a book inventory system, allowing users to track book titles, authors, and quantities. The project showcases the integration of PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js in a clean and organized architecture.

On the backend, it features a PostgreSQL database connected through an Express and Node.js API. The server handles all CRUD operations with RESTful endpoints that interact with the database, enabling the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of book records. The frontend, built with React, provides a user-friendly interface to display the list of books, add or edit entries through forms, and delete records — all with real-time UI updates.

This project demonstrates essential concepts such as state management in React, RESTful API communication, and backend–frontend separation of concerns. It also lays the foundation for more advanced features, like implementing database relationships (e.g., genres or categories), making it a solid example of building scalable full-stack applications.
